# Report - Module 2

## Module Overview

This module was initially intended to focus on designing and developing the app. However, after the first sprint, we decided to pivot our solution from an informational app to a fan club platform tailored for digital sports teams. This decision came after identifying weaknesses in our initial thesis and uncovering new opportunities, which led us to shift our strategy toward a B2B model. As a result, several adjustments were made to the project plan, raising new questions and requiring updates to our business documents.
