# Report - Module 2

## Module Overview

This module was initially intended to focus on designing and developing the app. However, after the first sprint, we decided to pivot our solution from an informational app to a fan club platform tailored for digital sports teams. This decision came after identifying weaknesses in our initial thesis and uncovering new opportunities, which led us to shift our strategy toward a B2B model. As a result, several adjustments were made to the project plan, raising new questions and requiring updates to our business documents.

## Project Pivoting

### Strategic Pivot Based on Mentor Insights

Following a series of insightful meetings with the mentors provided by Inteli and our academic advisor, we made the strategic decision to pivot from our project's current conceptual direction during this sprint. This decision was informed by the identification of certain structural weaknesses in our thesis, challenges in user acquisition, and the emergence of new opportunities previously overlooked. Among the key drivers behind this pivot was the difficulty of overcoming the network effect inherent in existing services. Many of the features we had envisioned for the informational aspect of the platform would be forced to compete in a saturated space: news, event updates, and player/match data, without offering a sufficiently differentiated value proposition. Our original solution did not intend to cover such a broad range of content, thereby limiting the incentive for users to transition from established platforms. Furthermore, regarding gamification, we recognized a missed opportunity in capitalizing on the monetization potential of such features, for both our business and for partner clubs. The rewards and incentive system we had previously proposed failed to effectively address the core user pain points in a meaningful or scalable way.

### Emerging Opportunity: B2B Ecosystem for eSports Fan Memberships

We have identified a promising opportunity in the B2B space: building a digital ecosystem tailored to fan membership programs for eSports clubs. Our platform enables new revenue streams and strengthens fan engagement by offering gamified experiences and providing clubs with actionable insights into both paying members and the wider audience.

At the core of our strategy is the idea of leveraging each club’s fanbase and brand to drive user acquisition and participation. Clubs retain full control over the rewards and benefits they offer, ensuring autonomy and alignment with their community. Our role is to provide the underlying technology and tools — allowing clubs to launch and manage these programs efficiently, without needing to build the infrastructure themselves.
