# Report - Module 3

## Module Overview

This module was objectively focused on putting all our research work into action. We used the first two sprints to consolidate the information we had, structure the business model, organize costs, and define our market vision in the roadmap, as well as develop the product design. The following sprints were focused on developing the product’s front-end and refining our sales materials and pitch.

## Context

The current context we are in focuses on understanding how to position ourselves in this market. We have identified the main failure points from previous cases, as well as major success stories in eSports investments. The key is to be strategic in using our app as an entry point for building relationships and to understand the different ways we can gradually solve existing problems. Alongside this, we are working to bring our market vision to life, the idea is to apply successful models from traditional sports to understand how we can drive growth in the eSports market and ride the wave of its expansion.

## Artifacts

### App 

We developed the app’s design using UX concepts we learned during our degree. The design was created in Figma, for both mobile and desktop versions. Our goal was to apply user experience principles such as the 60-30-10 color scheme, aligned with the color wheel standards. One of the main challenges was incorporating the colors of eSports teams into the app without compromising the established design logic. In the end, we achieved a satisfying result, a design that conveys both modernity and comfort.

### Front-End

The front-end development was carried out in three stages. First, we built the mobile web screens, where the app’s structural foundation was defined. This structure was then replicated in the second stage, focused on developing the native mobile app. Finally, we created the desktop web front-end. All developments were based on the React framework for JavaScript (and React Native for mobile), using the Shadcn UI library for components and Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Pitch and Presentation

The development of the pitch and slides was our main focus during this module. We aimed to refine our script in a clear and objective way, conducting occasional pitches to validate and improve it based on feedback.

In general, the presentation follows the following structural logic:

- Problem
- Company
- Solution
- Competitors
- Self-presentation

Each section includes several slides covering topics such as the eSports market, our business model, the vision we are leading, and relevant market case studies.

### Company Research and Updates

As mentioned earlier, we used this module to consolidate all our research on the market and its demands, conduct our own internal analysis, and translate it into a structured business model, solid market potential assessments, and a robust cost structure. To achieve this, we first updated all the business templates we had previously created in Module 1, including the SWOT Matrix, Risk Matrix, Personas, and Business Model Canvas.
